# csv_to_mysql
Python script that will import a csv file with hedders into a database.Â 

This script is intended to be used in two parts. First, a command is run that imports a csv file into a newly created database. The field names are taken from the headers in the csv and can be modified by the user before creating the database. The user will identify a field of the csv as a primary key. Second, subsequent csv's can then be imported into the same table. Each subsequent import will ignore primary keys of the csv's that already exist, ensuring no duplicate rows.
